abstract = {"Stop thinking like a supplier and start thinking as a customer.". The authors argue that cooperation may be achieved by augmenting the core product with technology-based services. Given the growing importance of real time information exchange and interactivity, a better understanding of the use of technology to the establishment and development of the buyer-supplier cooperative relationships is essential for knowledge advancement. This paper argues that firms should aim to put themselves into their customers' shoes and use the "voice of the customer" to take their major relationship management decisions. To do so, the authors use a sample of nearly 400 SMEs' purchasing managers, to better understand cooperation determinants from the buyers' perspective. The study reveals that in an electronic marketplace, cooperation is positively affected by termination costs, supplier relationship policies and practices, communication and information exchange, and negatively affected by product prices and opportunistic behavior. Moreover, both relationship commitment and trust play a major role in mediating the relationships between these five determinants and cooperation. Surprisingly, resources relationship benefits do not show a significant impact on either commitment or cooperation. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Currently, many other database technologies are grabbing more attention due to their high performance, scalability, and availability options, such as Not Only SQL (NoSQL) technologies. Choosing the right database technology for applications among a plethora of database options is a challenging task. This research aims to provide a systematic and experimental evaluation of four NoSQL databases across the spectrum of different NoSQL categories. The investigated databases are Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Cassandra. We study multiple aspects such as the database transaction support, query options, data layout, scalability, availability, security, and durability. Besides, we analyze the data modelling of each database using a data model from the Transaction Processing Council Ad-hoc (TPCH) benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate the query capabilities of each database using three complex queries from the same benchmark. Based on the examination, we capture the strengths and weaknesses each database has. Finally, we present a set of factors that influence the adoption of a NoSQL solution. These factors assist software architects and developers to choose the proper database technology for their specific application needs.},

A number of larger technology providers are now left to support both small and large businesses. Flexibility has been a key enabler in supporting network evolution across a varied number of domains. The aim of this study is to investigate flexibility around marketplace evolution, success and failure. In particular, explore the inter-relationships between architectural flexibility and the evolving Web and Internet. A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out in order to uncover the changes that have taken place over the past fifteen years. A conceptual model is produced early in the research in order to provide contextual underpinning. We employed a manual search of 5 journals. Of the 22 relevant studies, one addressed research trends around e-procurement in pharmaceutical organizations. Three addressed eprocurement in financial organizations. A number of flexibility categories are uncovered by the SLR and then used as a means to support flexible e-procurement marketplace (EPM) design and adoption, recognising EPM evolution over the volatile study period. Flexibility categories are uncovered and comprise technical, organisational, environmental and strategic (TOES) concerns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

@article{Herzig2012,
abstract = {Currently, gamification is a new trend under which all activities are subsumed that try to introduce game mechanics into non-gaming applications in order to increase user engagement, motivation, and participation. This approach is especially promising in the enterprise domain since enterprise information systems (EIS) mainly focus on efficiency aspects rather than individual long-term motivation and enjoyment. Prior research has shown that these latter variables lead to higher positive organizational outcomes, e.g., job performance. Additionally, first vendors have successfully implemented platforms for gamification. However, these platforms are designed for business-toconsumer (B2C) purposes, require high integration effort and lead to silo-based applications. Requirements for EIS strongly differ from consumer web or desktop applications. Hence, we present a generic platform for enterprise gamification. We derive an architecture for gamification systematically from serviceoriented and event-driven principles and best practices. Based on this architecture, we identify important research challenges for subsequent work. Ultimately, we validate the architecture's feasibility in a prototypical implementation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {A paradigm shift towards ‘sustainable mobility' has been proposed in the recent past. This paradigm encompasses three main approaches: efficiency increase, modal shift and reduction of mobility needs. The authors of this chapter focus on the first area by presenting efficiency potentials of innovative mobility concepts which flourish at the frontier of digital technologies, shared mobility patterns and vehicle automation. Not only do they provide an overview of these concepts, but they also make an attempt to innovate and design completely new business models. It is based on the authors' conviction that business model creation and innovation are crucial for a high diffusion of any new technology, as the necessary prerequisite for the industry is to gain profits out of innovative applications. The contribution at hand showcases current developments in car- and ridesharing by depicting two relevant case studies. Additionally, it provides a description of innovative mobility concepts based on vehicle digitization and automation, along with a review of their possible advantages and disadvantages for the society. Finally, the chapter features five ‘ready-for-implementation' business model prototypes for the future of automobility. In doing that the authors bring up novel ideas on how to commercialize and overcome the inefficiencies associated with private car ownership and usage.

Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Purpose - Electronic support of internal supply chains for direct or production goods has been a major element during the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that has taken place since the late 1980s. However, supply chains to indirect material suppliers were not usually included due to low transaction volumes, low product values and low strategic importance of these goods. Dedicated information systems for streamlining indirect goods supply chains have emerged since the late 1990s and subsequently have faced a broad diffusion in practice. The concept of these e-procurement solutions has also been described broadly in the literature. However, studies on how companies use these e-procurement solutions and what factors are critical to their implementation are only emerging. This research aims to explore the introduction of e-procurement systems and their contribution to the management of indirect goods supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Chooses a two-part qualitative approach. First, summarizes the results of a benchmarking study that was conducted by a consortium of 12 multinational companies. During the benchmarking process 120 questionnaires were distributed, ten phone-based interviews were conducted, and finally five successful practice companies were selected and analyzed in detail. Second, draws together the success factors identified in the benchmarking study and maps them against the successful practice companies. Findings - Although e-procurement has substantially streamlined the procurement and coordination processes for indirect goods, many companies operate multiple e-procurement solutions. For integrated procurement solutions, the paper recognizes the need of an overall procurement strategy and organization, an alignment of various e-procurement solutions along the procurement process and the need for integrated system architectures. Companies also have to realize that a no standardized e-procurement solutions exists and that important success factors are "non-technical" in nature. Originality/value - This paper presents a first step towards a systematic analysis of factors that may guide companies in the implementation of e-procurement solutions. Besides providing a direct contribution to the project work in companies it may stimulate further research in e-procurement success factors. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},
