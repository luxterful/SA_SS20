abstract = {During the last few years, a large number of new procurement business models has been developed, mostly concerning companies operating in the private sector. Their main objective is the introduction of new technologies such as e-business for the fulfilment of the procurement process of indirect goods. Lately, such models are also developed for organisations operating in the public sector all over Europe. This paper presents a case study concerning the analysis of the Greek governmental purchasing process carried out from the General Secretariat of Commerce, part of the Ministry of Development and the functions' definition of the new e-procurement system. The methodological approach as well as the tools used are analysed and the achieved results are presented. The objective of the analysis is the identification of potential problematic areas and the design of new processes in order to maximise the possibilities of a successful implementation of a new e-procurement system. The outcome of the new process design enabled the definition of the analytical functional specifications of the appropriate solution. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Electronic infrastructure in the service sector are reducing each kind of cost and improving multiply buyer–supplier relationships, facilitating negotiations and transactions. However, since the coordination costs are still high, the use of ICTs is limited. This phenomenon thus attracts the interests of scholars and practitioners. Although it still needs to further investigate. Especially, the optimal use of ICTs within SMEs' SCM have not been studied yet. Therefore, by leveraging on four proxies: ICTs specialised human resources, knowledge sharing activities, buyer–supplier relationships, adoption of electronic markets this optimal was analysed via structural equation modelling based on a sample of 1254 SMEs operating in the service sector in Italy.},

abstract = {Gamification is a buzz word in business these days. In its November 2012 press release, Gartner predicts that "by 2015, 40{\%} of Global 1000 organizations will use gamification as the primary mechanism to transform business operations". In the same report, they also predict that "by 2014, 80{\%} of current gamified applications will fail to meet business objectives, primarily due to poor design". What is gamification? Does it belong in the workplace? Are there design best practices that can increase the chance of success of enterprise gamification efforts? Janaki Kumar answers these questions and more in this paper Gamification @ Work. She cautions against taking a "chocolate covered broccoli" approach of simply adding points and badges to business applications and calling them gamified. She outlines a methodology called Player Centered Design which is a practical guide for user experience designers, product managers and developers to incorporate the principles of gamification into their software. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

We empirically investigate this by exploring the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on the participation and performance of over 100 undergraduate students in an online gamified learning intervention. The paper makes a number of contributions. First, by synthesizing the literature the central concepts required for a learning intervention to be considered gamified are mapped and the development of an online gamified learning intervention is described. Second, the effect of gamification on learning outcomes is examined using a pre- and post-intervention survey. We find that gamified learning interventions have a positive impact on student learning. Third, our results show that while generally positive, the impact of gamified intervention*ns on student participation varies depending on whether the student is motivated intrinsically or extrinsically. These findings will be of practical interest to teaching and learning practitioners working in a range of educational contexts, and at all levels of education, who wish to increase student engagement and enhance learning.},

In this paper we propose the timeboxing model for iterative software development in which each iteration is done in a time box of fixed duration, and the functionality to be built is adjusted to fit the time box. By dividing the time box into stages, pipelining concepts are employed to have multiple time boxes executing concurrently, leading to a reduction in the delivery time for product releases. We illustrate the use of this process model through an example of a commercial project that was successfully executed using the proposed model. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Given the growing importance of real time information exchange and interactivity, a better understanding of the use of technology to the establishment and development of the buyer-supplier cooperative relationships is essential for knowledge advancement. This paper argues that firms should aim to put themselves into their customers' shoes and use the "voice of the customer" to take their major relationship management decisions. To do so, the authors use a sample of nearly 400 SMEs' purchasing managers, to better understand cooperation determinants from the buyers' perspective. The study reveals that in an electronic marketplace, cooperation is positively affected by termination costs, supplier relationship policies and practices, communication and information exchange, and negatively affected by product prices and opportunistic behavior. Moreover, both relationship commitment and trust play a major role in mediating the relationships between these five determinants and cooperation. Surprisingly, resources relationship benefits do not show a significant impact on either commitment or cooperation. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {For the past few decades, relational databases have been the default choice for data storage, especially for enterprise applications. Currently, many other database technologies are grabbing more attention due to their high performance, scalability, and availability options, such as Not Only SQL (NoSQL) technologies. Choosing the right database technology for applications among a plethora of database options is a challenging task. This research aims to provide a systematic and experimental evaluation of four NoSQL databases across the spectrum of different NoSQL categories. The investigated databases are Redis, MongoDB, Neo4j, and Cassandra. We study multiple aspects such as the database transaction support, query options, data layout, scalability, availability, security, and durability. Besides, we analyze the data modelling of each database using a data model from the Transaction Processing Council Ad-hoc (TPCH) benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate the query capabilities of each database using three complex queries from the same benchmark. Based on the examination, we capture the strengths and weaknesses each database has. Finally, we present a set of factors that influence the adoption of a NoSQL solution. These factors assist software architects and developers to choose the proper database technology for their specific application needs.},

We introduced a new approach to player types based on mastery and performance gaming achievement goals. Four types are studied: super-achievers, mastery-only, performance-only, and non-achievers. We also examined the relationship between our four achievement goal player types to the traditional achiever, explorer player types. We found that Interest in exploration in games can exist in any of the four types, but those with strong mastery goals have the lowest interest in exploration. Gender and gaming frequency were significantly related to gaming achievement goals.

abstract = {Gamification is the "use of game design elements in non-game contexts" (Deterding et al, 2011, p.1). A frequently used model for gamification is to equate an activity in the non-game context with points and have external rewards for reaching specified point thresholds. One significant problem with this model of gamification is that it can reduce the internal motivation that the user has for the activity, as it replaces internal motivation with external motivation. If, however, the game design elements can be made meaningful to the user through information, then internal motivation can be improved as there is less need to emphasize external rewards. This paper introduces the concept of meaningful gamification through a user-centered exploration of theories behind organismic integration theory, situational relevance, situated motivational affordance, universal design for learning, and player-generated content.},

@article{Puschmann2005,
abstract = {Purpose - Electronic support of internal supply chains for direct or production goods has been a major element during the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that has taken place since the late 1980s. However, supply chains to indirect material suppliers were not usually included due to low transaction volumes, low product values and low strategic importance of these goods. Dedicated information systems for streamlining indirect goods supply chains have emerged since the late 1990s and subsequently have faced a broad diffusion in practice. The concept of these e-procurement solutions has also been described broadly in the literature. However, studies on how companies use these e-procurement solutions and what factors are critical to their implementation are only emerging. This research aims to explore the introduction of e-procurement systems and their contribution to the management of indirect goods supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - Chooses a two-part qualitative approach. First, summarizes the results of a benchmarking study that was conducted by a consortium of 12 multinational companies. During the benchmarking process 120 questionnaires were distributed, ten phone-based interviews were conducted, and finally five successful practice companies were selected and analyzed in detail. Second, draws together the success factors identified in the benchmarking study and maps them against the successful practice companies. Findings - Although e-procurement has substantially streamlined the procurement and coordination processes for indirect goods, many companies operate multiple e-procurement solutions. For integrated procurement solutions, the paper recognizes the need of an overall procurement strategy and organization, an alignment of various e-procurement solutions along the procurement process and the need for integrated system architectures. Companies also have to realize that a no standardized e-procurement solutions exists and that important success factors are "non-technical" in nature. Originality/value - This paper presents a first step towards a systematic analysis of factors that may guide companies in the implementation of e-procurement solutions. Besides providing a direct contribution to the project work in companies it may stimulate further research in e-procurement success factors. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Currently, gamification is a new trend under which all activities are subsumed that try to introduce game mechanics into non-gaming applications in order to increase user engagement, motivation, and participation. This approach is especially promising in the enterprise domain since enterprise information systems (EIS) mainly focus on efficiency aspects rather than individual long-term motivation and enjoyment. Prior research has shown that these latter variables lead to higher positive organizational outcomes, e.g., job performance. Additionally, first vendors have successfully implemented platforms for gamification. However, these platforms are designed for business-toconsumer (B2C) purposes, require high integration effort and lead to silo-based applications. Requirements for EIS strongly differ from consumer web or desktop applications. Hence, we present a generic platform for enterprise gamification. We derive an architecture for gamification systematically from serviceoriented and event-driven principles and best practices. Based on this architecture, we identify important research challenges for subsequent work. Ultimately, we validate the architecture's feasibility in a prototypical implementation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Supply Chain and Supply chain Management have played a significant role in corporate efficiency and have attracted the attention of numerous academicians over the last few years. Academic literature review discloses an important spurt in research in practice and theory of Supply Chain (SC) and Supply Chain Management (SCM). Connecting and informing on Supply Chain, Supply Chain Management and distribution Management characteristics have contributed to the Supply Chain integration. This integration has generated the approach of extended corporate and the supply chain is nowadays manifested as the cooperative supply chain across intercorporate borders to increase the value across of the whole supply chain. This paper seeks to introduce supply Chain and Supply Chain Management. A Supply Chain and Supply Chain Management definition, theoretical, practical and measurement analysis are proposed. Several randomly selected refereed academic articles were methodically analyzed. A number of key findings have arisen: the field is a comparatively new one; several researchers have different perception of the discipline; the consensus is lacking on the definition of the terms: the Supply Chain and Supply Chain Management are widely defined; contextual focus is mainly on the manufacturing industry; research methods employed are mostly theoretical conceptual; the findings also suggest that undertaking a theory view could make important contributions towards defining the scope of supply chains. The literature review in this research proposes critical lexicons that are mostly used in academic dissertation. These notions can be beneficial for academician or organizations that are involve in Supply Chain Management business. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new social media infrastructure, named micro-crowdfunding, for motivating people to participate in improving our society. Increasing people's awareness of how they participate in solving serious social problems is central to achieving a sustainable society. Micro-crowdfunding is a new type of community-based crowdsourcing architecture that is based on the micro-level crowdfunding concept and designs the values as a tool for encouraging busy people who live in urban environments to increase their awareness of the importance of participating in activities to improve society through minimal efforts. Because our approach is lightweight and uses a mobile phone, people can participate in micro-crowdfunding activities with little effort anytime and anywhere. After introducing the basic concept of micro-crowdfunding, three scenarios are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of this new social media infrastructure. The first scenario adopts virtual currency, and its basic operation is similar to that of traditional crowdfunding. We analyze how the current design described in the scenarios influences participants in micro-crowdfunding activities and show some pitfalls of the design that cause problems when some users do not find the service valuable. We then present two more scenarios to improve upon the first scenario. The second scenario incorporates virtuality, and the third scenario incorporates fictionality to enhance micro-crowdfunding activities. These scenarios adopt popular strategies used in games to increase people's motivation to participate in more micro-crowdfunding activities. We also analyze how the enhancements influence participants' behavior in the scenarios. Finally, we describe experiences with using a real working prototype system to validate the scenario-based analysis.},

abstract = {During the Web era e-procurement has witnessed a steep rise in marketplace deployment; this has been followed by a substantial number of failures. A number of larger technology providers are now left to support both small and large businesses. Flexibility has been a key enabler in supporting network evolution across a varied number of domains. The aim of this study is to investigate flexibility around marketplace evolution, success and failure. In particular, explore the inter-relationships between architectural flexibility and the evolving Web and Internet. A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out in order to uncover the changes that have taken place over the past fifteen years. A conceptual model is produced early in the research in order to provide contextual underpinning. We employed a manual search of 5 journals. Of the 22 relevant studies, one addressed research trends around e-procurement in pharmaceutical organizations. Three addressed eprocurement in financial organizations. A number of flexibility categories are uncovered by the SLR and then used as a means to support flexible e-procurement marketplace (EPM) design and adoption, recognising EPM evolution over the volatile study period. Flexibility categories are uncovered and comprise technical, organisational, environmental and strategic (TOES) concerns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Universidad de Talca - Chile.},

abstract = {A paradigm shift towards ‘sustainable mobility' has been proposed in the recent past. This paradigm encompasses three main approaches: efficiency increase, modal shift and reduction of mobility needs. The authors of this chapter focus on the first area by presenting efficiency potentials of innovative mobility concepts which flourish at the frontier of digital technologies, shared mobility patterns and vehicle automation. Not only do they provide an overview of these concepts, but they also make an attempt to innovate and design completely new business models. It is based on the authors' conviction that business model creation and innovation are crucial for a high diffusion of any new technology, as the necessary prerequisite for the industry is to gain profits out of innovative applications. The contribution at hand showcases current developments in car- and ridesharing by depicting two relevant case studies. Additionally, it provides a description of innovative mobility concepts based on vehicle digitization and automation, along with a review of their possible advantages and disadvantages for the society. Finally, the chapter features five ‘ready-for-implementation' business model prototypes for the future of automobility. In doing that the authors bring up novel ideas on how to commercialize and overcome the inefficiencies associated with private car ownership and usage. [This chapter is based on the outcomes of the doctoral thesis ‘Paradigm Shift in Urban Mobility: Towards Factor 10 of Automobility' (Janasz 2016 forthcoming)].},
