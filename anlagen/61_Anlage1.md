Contact is only possible within a demand:

- no option to communicate or build a relationship outside of a demand
- not even possible to see who is on scoutbee (for both sides)
- no “follow” functionality
- no “news” functionality
- no option to chat outside of a demand
- no option to chat with specific people (inside & outside of a demand)
- inside a demand it is always the whole group

General lack of personality:

- no profile pictures are uploaded on the platform
- purchasers only do what is necessary
- language barriers here and there
- not much time spend on the platform due to no possible “activities” / nothing going on (both sides)

Problems on purchaser side:

- Purchasers often do not answer suppliers

  - when they submit an RFI feedback and do not proceed to the SL (no option on the platform, except the chat)
  - when they submit a proposal
  - when the demand is finished they get (no option on the platform, except the chat)

- answer time of purchasers is very long
- some purchasers do not reply to supplier messages at all
- purchasers can always contact suppliers when they are in a demand, suppliers only when they get to SL
- manual work needed at several touch points of Streamline process. CSMs need to constantly remind and encourage purchasers to do:

  - Demand creation
  - adequate RFI description
  - Review DeepSee profiles on the longlist (can be
  - Use the chat to collaborate with potential suppliers

- Purchasers tend to have the impression the manual work should be done by the CSMs.

Problems on supplier side:

- registered suppliers engage more in the collaboration chat because they are looking for the business
- no benchmark for a well filled out supplier profile. Visibility of other supplier profiles would help here
- suppliers do not have a good motivation to fill out their profiles/ do not know the benefit (there is also no benefit currently)
- absolutely no value for suppliers on scoutbee if they are not invited to a demand
- suppliers are often impatient and want to submit a proposal right at the beginning of demand
- suppliers should participate in further demands but usually don't
